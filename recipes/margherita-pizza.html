    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This naan bread pizza recipe is one of my favorite Friday night dishes. 
        This pizza is quick, simple, and delicious. 
        Instead of making the pizza dough from scratch, I decided to use naan bread 
        for the pizza base. Using naan bread saves time and is also great for portion 
        control. The only difference between this recipe and most pizza recipes is that 
        it doesn't include tomato sauce on the base. I don't like the sogginess that comes 
        from the sauce but feel free to try it with the sauce, as it will still yield good 
        results.This naan bread pizza recipe is one of my favorite Friday night dishes.

            Sprinkle green onion and garlic over each naan. Arrange 4 slices mozzarella cheese 
            onto each naan; top with tomato slices. Season tomatoes with salt and pepper.
